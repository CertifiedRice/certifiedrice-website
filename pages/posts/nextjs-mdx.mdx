# Using MDX with Next.js

## What is MDX?
<p>MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.</p>

# Why you should use MDX
When documenting or writing a blog post with just plain text or HTMl is very painful!\
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses a plain text editor to make any documentation or post pop!\
And it's really easy to use! Companies/platforms such as GitHub uses it, and it's a useful tool all devs must have!

# Using it with Next.js
Install it by running the following command:

```bash
npm i @mdx-js/mdx
npm i@next/mdx
```

# Implementing it into next.js

In your `next.config.js` file, add the following:

```js
const withMDX = require ('@next/mdx')();

module.exports = withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx'],
});
```

<hr></hr>

<p>Now, you can use the file extension `.mdx`</p>
<p>We recommend you make a `posts` directory or a `docs` directory to store all of your `.mdx` files</p>
<p>Now you can write Markdown text and also JSX code in your `.mdx` file!</p>

### Have fun coding!
